### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical leader on Dev team at Bamaying. Iâ€™m currently working on [Baiji(a nodejs rest api framework)](https://github.com/baijijs/baiji) and [EWA(a wechat mini program build tool)](https://github.com/lyfeyaj/ewa/), and many other interesting [projects](./my-open-sources.md).

Here are some of my [thoughts](./thoughts/README.md) about coding/product/design.
